# Universal FOV Changer

### Info

This is a quick project I've done called Universal FOV Changer

As the name says, you can change the FOV from any game by using this roblox script. <br />
You do need a pretty decent executor to run this.

If the "Copy Discord Link" button does not work for you, your executor does not support "setclipboard", consider using KRNL or Evon. <br />
You have the discord invite link all the way down of this README too.

### Why should you choose our script?

✅ Bypasses change-back methods <br />
     ex: Strucid changes the camera fov back to default if you try to manually change it <br />
✅ Supports KRNL, Evon & more free executors <br />
     ex: Even executors that use EasyXploits API! <br />
✅ Customizable menu <br />
     ex: You can change the background or accent color of the menu <br />
✅ Menu can be closed <br />
     Use Right Shift to toggle the menu on and off <br />
✅ Discord support for any errors or suggestions <br />
     If you would like to see anything changed or added to this project, consider joining the discord server and going to the suggestions channel <br />
