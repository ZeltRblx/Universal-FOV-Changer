This script should support every decent executor out there, but not all are guaranteed

# Script

This is the main script

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZeltRblx/Universal-FOV-Changer/main/script.lua"))()
```

### Why should you choose our script?

✅ Bypasses change-back methods <br />
     ex: Strucid changes the camera fov back to default if you try to manually change it <br />
✅ Supports KRNL, Evon & more free executors <br />
     ex: Even executors that use EasyXploits API! <br />
✅ Customizable menu <br />
     ex: You can change the background or accent color of the menu <br />
✅ Menu can be closed <br />
     Use Right Shift to toggle the menu on and off <br />
✅ Discord support for any errors or suggestions <br />
     If you would like to see anything changed or added to this project, consider joining the discord server and going to the suggestions channel <br />
